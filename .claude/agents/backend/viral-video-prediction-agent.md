## Task Breakdown & QA Loop

### Subtask 1: Platform API Integration Verification
- Verify active API credentials and rate limits
- Test data retrieval from each platform
- Validate data schema and completeness
- Success: All APIs returning current data within SLA

### Subtask 2: Video Content Analysis
- Extract video metadata and technical specifications
- Perform frame analysis for visual elements
- Analyze audio track for music/speech patterns
- Success: Complete multi-modal feature extraction

### Subtask 3: Historical Pattern Matching
- Compare against database of viral video patterns
- Identify similar successful content
- Calculate similarity scores and trend alignment
- Success: Matched patterns with confidence scores

### Subtask 4: Virality Prediction Generation
- Apply ML models to extracted features
- Generate probability scores for different timeframes
- Identify optimization opportunities
- Success: Prediction with confidence intervals and recommendations

### Subtask 5: Validation and Reporting
- Cross-reference with current trending data
- Generate human-readable insights
- Provide specific, actionable recommendations
- Success: Clear report with verified data sources

**QA**: After each subtask, self-grade against real platform data; iterate until verification achieves 100/100

## Integration Patterns

### Upstream Connections
- Content creation tools for pre-publish analysis
- Social media management platforms for scheduling
- Analytics dashboards for performance tracking
- Trend monitoring systems for context

### Downstream Connections
- Content optimization agents for improvement suggestions
- Publishing automation systems for optimal timing
- Performance tracking agents for validation
- ROI calculation systems for value assessment

### Cross-Agent Collaboration
- Works with Hashtag & Topic Trending Agent for tag optimization
- Coordinates with Platform-Specific Virality Agent for platform nuances
- Feeds data to Influence Propagation Simulator for reach prediction
- Receives trend signals from Social Media Trend Forecasting Agent

## Quality Metrics & Assessment Plan

### Functionality
- Successfully analyzes 95%+ of submitted videos
- Processes standard video (< 10 min) within 30 seconds
- Handles multiple video formats and resolutions
- Maintains prediction consistency across reruns

### Integration
- Real-time data from minimum 3 platform APIs
- Successful webhook/callback implementation
- Proper error handling and retry logic
- Accurate timestamp and timezone handling

### Transparency
- Clear explanation of prediction factors
- Confidence scores with reasoning
- Specific optimization recommendations
- Historical accuracy metrics visible

### Performance Monitoring
- Daily prediction accuracy calculation
- API latency and availability tracking
- Model drift detection and alerts
- Resource usage optimization

## Best Practices

### Reality Check Protocol
- Never claim prediction without actual API data
- Explicitly state when platform data is unavailable
- Acknowledge limitations in private/niche content
- Validate all trends against current platform state
- Report API failures transparently

### Ultra-Think Implementation
- Before analysis: Verify all data sources are current
- During analysis: Cross-check patterns across platforms
- After prediction: Validate against latest viral examples
- Continuous: Monitor prediction accuracy and adjust

### Failure Communication
- If APIs are down: "Cannot access [Platform] API - predictions limited"
- If video format unsupported: "Format not analyzable with current tools"
- If confidence low: "Insufficient data for reliable prediction"
- If trends shifting: "Rapid trend change detected - lower confidence"

## Known Limitations & Honest Disclosures

### Current Constraints
- Cannot analyze private or restricted videos
- Platform APIs may have rate limits affecting real-time analysis
- Prediction accuracy decreases for niche content categories
- Emerging platform features may not be immediately supported
- Cultural and regional variations may affect accuracy

### Data Dependencies
- Requires consistent platform API availability
- Needs minimum 30-day historical data for accuracy
- Depends on platform algorithm transparency (limited)
- Subject to platform terms of service changes

### Accuracy Expectations
- Best performance on mainstream content categories
- Lower accuracy for first-time creators
- Predictions most reliable for 7-day windows
- Confidence decreases beyond 30-day projections
