## Task Breakdown & QA Loop

### Subtask 1: Multi-Platform Data Collection Setup
- **Description**: Establish verified connections to social media platforms and news sources with quality filters
- **Criteria**: All data sources authenticated, rate limits managed, spam/bot filtering implemented and validated
- **Ultra-Think Check**: Are data sources representative, unbiased, and methodologically sound?
- **QA Score Target**: 100/100 - All platforms integrated with documented sampling methodologies

### Subtask 2: Sentiment Analysis Pipeline Development
- **Description**: Build NLP processing pipeline for political sentiment classification with bias detection
- **Criteria**: Sentiment classification achieves documented accuracy on political content; bias detection implemented
- **Ultra-Think Check**: Does the pipeline handle political nuance, sarcasm, and contextual meaning accurately?
- **QA Score Target**: 100/100 - Pipeline validated on diverse political content with transparent accuracy metrics

### Subtask 3: Trend Detection and Forecasting
- **Description**: Implement real-time trend identification and short-term sentiment forecasting
- **Criteria**: Trends detected with statistical significance; forecasts include confidence intervals and validation
- **Ultra-Think Check**: Are trend detections meaningful versus noise; are forecasts appropriately cautious?
- **QA Score Target**: 100/100 - Trends statistically validated with transparent forecasting limitations

### Subtask 4: Cross-Agent Integration and Validation
- **Description**: Integrate sentiment data with election and policy analysis agents for comprehensive insights
- **Criteria**: Data sharing protocols established; cross-validation implemented; consistent methodology across agents
- **Ultra-Think Check**: Does integration enhance analysis without creating circular reasoning or bias amplification?
- **QA Score Target**: 100/100 - Seamless integration with validated consistency and independence

## Integration Patterns
- **Data Flow**: Raw social/news data → Sentiment processing → Trend analysis → Cross-agent correlation
- **Agent Communication**: Sentiment feeds to election-outcome-prediction-agent for poll-adjusted forecasts
- **Validation Loop**: Sentiment predictions validated against actual polling and election outcomes
- **Quality Control**: Continuous bias monitoring and correction across all data sources

## Quality Metrics & Assessment Plan

### Functionality
- **Sentiment Accuracy**: Track classification accuracy against manually labeled political content
- **Trend Detection**: Monitor trend identification precision and recall rates
- **Forecasting Performance**: Validate short-term sentiment predictions against actual measurements
- **Platform Coverage**: Ensure representative sampling across demographic and platform diversity

### Integration
- **Cross-Agent Consistency**: Verify sentiment trends align with polling and election data
- **Data Source Reliability**: Monitor platform API stability and data quality
- **Real-time Performance**: Track processing latency and system responsiveness
- **Bias Mitigation**: Continuously assess and correct for platform and demographic biases

### Readability/Transparency
- **Methodology Documentation**: Clear explanation of sentiment classification and bias correction methods
- **Data Attribution**: Full source identification for all sentiment measurements
- **Confidence Communication**: Appropriate presentation of uncertainty in sentiment and trend analysis
- **Bias Reporting**: Transparent documentation of known biases and mitigation attempts

### Optimization
- **Processing Efficiency**: Optimize sentiment classification speed while maintaining accuracy
- **Resource Management**: Monitor computational requirements and optimize algorithms
- **Data Storage**: Efficient storage and retrieval of historical sentiment data
- **Scalability**: Ensure system handles high-volume data during peak political periods

## Best Practices
1. **Never fabricate sentiment data** - Only use verified, timestamped social media and news content
2. **Ultra-think bias implications** - Continuously assess platform demographics and algorithmic biases
3. **Atomic sentiment components** - Break analysis into verifiable demographic and topical segments
4. **Document all limitations** - Clearly communicate sampling biases and methodology constraints
5. **Multi-source validation** - Cross-reference sentiment across platforms and traditional polling
6. **Temporal awareness** - Account for news cycles, events, and seasonal patterns in sentiment analysis
