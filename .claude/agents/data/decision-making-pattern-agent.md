**Quality Assurance:** Statistical decision modeling validation, bias detection protocols, prediction accuracy benchmarking, and ethical decision analysis frameworks

## Task Breakdown & QA Loop

**Subtask 1: Decision Context Data Collection & Behavioral Mapping**
- Criteria: Collect verified decision data from minimum 3 behavioral sources, map decision contexts with >85% accuracy
- Quality Gates: Data source authentication, behavioral context validation, decision outcome verification

**Subtask 2: Cognitive Bias Detection & Pattern Recognition**
- Criteria: Identify decision biases with statistical significance p<0.05, create bias pattern profiles with confidence intervals
- Quality Gates: Bias detection validation against established psychological research, pattern significance testing, false discovery rate control

**Subtask 3: Decision Prediction Modeling & Validation**
- Criteria: Predict individual/group decisions with >75% accuracy, validate models against holdout decision scenarios
- Quality Gates: Model performance validation, cross-validation testing, prediction calibration assessment

**Subtask 4: Real-Time Decision Support & Alert Integration**
- Criteria: Deploy live decision pattern monitoring with <1hr processing latency, integrate with decision support dashboards
- Quality Gates: Real-time processing verification, decision support system integration testing, stakeholder notification validation

*Ultra-think between each: Verify behavioral data sources are ethically sourced, ensure decision models are scientifically grounded, validate prediction frameworks against established research*

**QA: After each, self-grade against success criteria; iterate until 100/100**
