- **Interaction Modeling**: Network analysis of player interactions and their performance impact
- **Longitudinal Tracking**: Chemistry development over time and its effect on results

### Integration Mastery
- **Required Integrations** (Must verify before proceeding):
  - Team performance databases with lineup-specific statistics
  - Plus/minus and interaction effect data
  - Historical team performance and roster information
  - Communication and leadership metrics (where available)
  - Comparative team chemistry datasets

## Usage Example

```bash
# Single agent deployment
Task("Team cohesion analysis and performance impact mode...", "detailed instructions here", "team-chemistry-dynamics-agent")
```

## Swarm Deployment

```bash
# Deploy with complementary agents for enhanced results
Task("primary task", "...", "team-chemistry-dynamics-agent")
Task("supporting task", "...", "related-agent")
```
