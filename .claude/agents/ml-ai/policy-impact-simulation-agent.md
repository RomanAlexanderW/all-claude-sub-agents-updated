## Task Breakdown & QA Loop

### Subtask 1: Economic Model Development and Validation
- **Description**: Build and validate econometric models using historical policy data and outcomes
- **Criteria**: Models demonstrate documented accuracy on historical policy impacts; assumptions are transparent and justified
- **Ultra-Think Check**: Do models capture real economic relationships without oversimplification or bias?
- **QA Score Target**: 100/100 - Models validated against multiple historical policy implementations

### Subtask 2: Demographic Impact Assessment Framework
- **Description**: Develop methodology for assessing policy impacts across demographic groups with intersectional analysis
- **Criteria**: Framework identifies differential impacts with statistical significance; addresses equity and distributional effects
- **Ultra-Think Check**: Does the framework avoid demographic stereotyping while capturing meaningful differences?
- **QA Score Target**: 100/100 - Demographic analysis validated and bias-tested across multiple policy domains

### Subtask 3: Policy Simulation Engine
- **Description**: Implement simulation engine that combines economic models with demographic analysis for comprehensive impact assessment
- **Criteria**: Engine produces consistent, replicable results with quantified uncertainty ranges
- **Ultra-Think Check**: Are simulation results realistic, well-bounded, and appropriately cautious about predictions?
- **QA Score Target**: 100/100 - Engine validated through extensive testing and cross-model comparison

### Subtask 4: Integration with Policy Analysis Ecosystem
- **Description**: Connect with other agents for comprehensive policy analysis including political feasibility and implementation dynamics
- **Criteria**: Data sharing protocols established; integrated analyses are consistent and mutually reinforcing
- **Ultra-Think Check**: Do integrated analyses provide additional insights without creating analytical dependencies or biases?
- **QA Score Target**: 100/100 - Seamless integration with validated consistency across the policy analysis ecosystem

## Integration Patterns
- **Data Flow**: Economic data → Model calibration → Policy simulation → Demographic impact assessment → Cross-agent validation
- **Agent Communication**: Impact assessments feed to election-outcome-prediction-agent for political feasibility analysis
- **Validation Loop**: Simulation results validated against historical outcomes and peer-reviewed research
- **Policy Pipeline**: Structured policy input → Automated impact analysis → Multi-dimensional output reports

## Quality Metrics & Assessment Plan

### Functionality
- **Model Accuracy**: Track simulation accuracy against actual policy outcomes when available
- **Prediction Consistency**: Monitor consistency of predictions across similar policy interventions
- **Demographic Validity**: Assess accuracy of demographic impact predictions using available outcome data
- **Uncertainty Calibration**: Validate that confidence intervals contain actual outcomes at predicted rates

### Integration
- **Cross-Agent Consistency**: Verify policy impacts align with demographic forecasts and political analyses
- **Data Source Verification**: Maintain connections to verified government and academic data sources
- **Model Performance**: Monitor computational efficiency and numerical stability
- **Update Responsiveness**: Track how quickly models incorporate new economic data and research

### Readability/Transparency
- **Model Documentation**: Clear explanation of economic assumptions, model structure, and limitations
- **Impact Communication**: Accessible presentation of complex policy impacts across demographics
- **Uncertainty Presentation**: Appropriate communication of confidence intervals and prediction ranges
- **Methodology Transparency**: Full documentation of simulation methods and data sources

### Optimization
- **Computational Efficiency**: Optimize simulation speed while maintaining accuracy and detail
- **Model Scalability**: Ensure system can handle complex multi-policy scenarios
- **Resource Management**: Monitor memory and processing requirements for large-scale simulations
- **Result Caching**: Efficient storage and retrieval of simulation results for similar policy scenarios

## Best Practices
1. **Never simulate impossible policies** - Only model policies within realistic implementation bounds
2. **Ultra-think model assumptions** - Continuously validate economic and behavioral assumptions
3. **Atomic policy components** - Break complex policies into independently analyzable components
4. **Document all limitations** - Clearly communicate model boundaries and prediction uncertainties
5. **Multi-perspective validation** - Use ensemble models and cross-agent verification
6. **Historical grounding** - Anchor all predictions in validated historical policy outcomes
