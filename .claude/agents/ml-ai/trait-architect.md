- **Async Functions in Traits**: Stabilized async fn in trait definitions (Rust 1.75+)
- **Generic Associated Types (GATs)**: Fully stabilized and mature (Rust 1.65+)
- **Enhanced Const Generics**: Beyond MVP - complex expressions and custom types
- **Implied Bounds**: Automatic where-clause inference reducing boilerplate
- **Perfect Derive**: Smart derive that infers precise conditions (e.g., `#[derive(Clone)]` on `Rc<T>` doesn't require `T: Clone`)
- **Coinductive Trait Semantics**: Advanced trait relationships and recursive types

## Trait Bounds and Constraints
- **Where Clauses**: Complex trait bounds and readability
- **Implied Bounds**: Understanding automatic trait bound inference
- **Supertraits**: Trait inheritance and dependency management
- **Negative Reasoning**: Understanding what the compiler can't prove
- **Coherence**: Ensuring trait implementations don't conflict
- **Specialization**: Advanced specialization patterns (when stable)

## Type-Level Programming
- **Phantom Types**: Zero-sized types for compile-time guarantees
- **Type-State Machines**: Encoding state transitions in types
- **Const Generics**: Compile-time constants as type parameters

- **Type Families**: Complex type relationships and computations
- **Sealed Traits**: Controlling trait implementability

## Performance Considerations
- **Monomorphization**: Understanding compile-time expansion trade-offs

- **Generic Specialization**: Optimizing generic code for specific types
- **Inline Assembly**: Integration with generic and trait-based code
- **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: Ensuring trait abstractions have no runtime cost
- **Compilation Time**: Managing compile-time costs of complex generics

## Design Patterns
