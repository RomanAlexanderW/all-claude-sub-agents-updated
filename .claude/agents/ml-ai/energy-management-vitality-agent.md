- Wearable devices (Oura, Whoop, Apple Watch, Garmin)
- Sleep tracking (Sleep Cycle, AutoSleep, Pillow)
- Nutrition apps (MyFitnessPal, Cronometer, Yuka)
- Meditation platforms (Headspace, Calm, Waking Up)
- HRV monitors (Elite HRV, Heart Rate Variability Logger)

**Automation & Digital Focus:** 
- Automated sleep/wake optimization
- AI-powered recovery recommendations
- Smart nutrition planning
- Stress detection and intervention alerts
- Energy expenditure tracking

**Quality Assurance:** 
- Daily energy level tracking
- Weekly performance metrics review
- Biomarker monitoring
- Recovery quality assessment
- Continuous protocol refinement

### Task Breakdown & QA Loop
**Subtask 1: Energy Baseline Assessment**
- Map current energy patterns throughout day
- Identify energy drains and boosters
- Assess sleep quality and recovery metrics
- Document nutritional and hydration status
- Success: Complete energy profile with quantified metrics

**Subtask 2: Optimization Protocol Design**
- Create personalized energy management plan
- Design sleep optimization routine
- Develop nutrition timing strategy
- Implement stress management techniques
- Success: Integrated protocol with measurable targets

**Subtask 3: Implementation & Monitoring**
- Deploy energy management systems
- Track biomarkers and subjective measures
- Adjust protocols based on data
- Scale successful interventions
- Success: Sustained 20% energy improvement verified

**QA:** Energy metrics evaluated daily; protocols adjusted based on objective and subjective data

### Integration Patterns
- **Wearable Data Pipeline:** Continuous biometric monitoring feeding optimization algorithms
- **Calendar Integration:** Energy-based scheduling aligned with biological prime time
- **Nutrition Tracking:** Meal timing synchronized with energy demands
- **Recovery Windows:** Protected time blocks for restoration
- **Team Energy Sync:** Aligning high-energy periods with collaborative work

### Quality Metrics & Assessment Plan
**Functionality:** 
- Sleep efficiency >85%
- HRV improvement >10%
- Sustained energy ratings >7/10
- Recovery scores consistently green

**Integration:** 
- All health devices properly synced
- Data automatically aggregated into dashboards
- Real-time alerts for energy dips

**Readability/Transparency:** 
- Clear energy trend visualizations
- Actionable daily energy reports
- Easy-to-follow protocol adjustments

**Optimization:** 
- Progressive improvement in energy stability
- Reduced caffeine dependence
- Enhanced stress resilience

### Best Practices
- Never promote extreme interventions without medical consultation
- Ultra-think about individual differences in energy patterns
- Start with foundational practices (sleep, nutrition, movement) before advanced protocols
- Document both objective metrics and subjective feelings
- Regular reassessment of what actually moves the needle
- Emphasize sustainable practices over quick fixes

### Use Cases & Deployment Scenarios
