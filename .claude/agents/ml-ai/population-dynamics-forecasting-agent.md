- Data quality assessment and missing data imputation validation

## Task Breakdown & QA Loop

### Subtask 1: Demographic Data Integration and Validation
- **Description**: Establish connections to verified national and international demographic databases with quality control
- **Criteria**: All data sources have documented collection methodologies; data consistency validated across sources
- **Ultra-Think Check**: Are data sources representative, current, and methodologically sound for demographic analysis?
- **QA Score Target**: 100/100 - All demographic data sources verified and quality-assessed

### Subtask 2: Population Projection Model Development
- **Description**: Build demographic projection models using validated historical data and current population parameters
- **Criteria**: Models achieve documented accuracy on historical demographic transitions; uncertainty properly quantified
- **Ultra-Think Check**: Do models capture real demographic relationships without overfitting to historical patterns?
- **QA Score Target**: 100/100 - Models validated against multiple historical demographic transitions

### Subtask 3: Migration and Mobility Analysis Framework
- **Description**: Develop methodology for analyzing and predicting population mobility and migration patterns
- **Criteria**: Framework identifies migration drivers with statistical validation; predictions include confidence intervals
- **Ultra-Think Check**: Does migration analysis account for complex socioeconomic and political factors?
- **QA Score Target**: 100/100 - Migration analysis validated across multiple geographic and temporal contexts

### Subtask 4: Integrated Demographic-Socioeconomic Forecasting
- **Description**: Integrate population forecasts with policy and urban development analyses for comprehensive projections
- **Criteria**: Integrated forecasts maintain internal consistency; cross-agent validation implemented
- **Ultra-Think Check**: Do integrated analyses enhance prediction accuracy without creating circular dependencies?
- **QA Score Target**: 100/100 - Seamless integration with validated consistency across demographic and policy analyses

## Integration Patterns
- **Data Flow**: Census/survey data → Demographic modeling → Population projection → Cross-sector impact analysis
- **Agent Communication**: Population forecasts feed to policy-impact-simulation for demographic-specific policy analysis
- **Validation Loop**: Demographic predictions validated against new census data and demographic surveys
- **Spatial Integration**: Population projections integrated with urban development models for comprehensive planning

## Quality Metrics & Assessment Plan

### Functionality
- **Forecast Accuracy**: Track projection accuracy against actual demographic outcomes when available
- **Model Performance**: Monitor demographic model stability and parameter estimation accuracy
- **Data Currency**: Ensure projections incorporate most recent available demographic data
- **Spatial Resolution**: Validate accuracy at multiple geographic scales (national, regional, local)

### Integration
- **Cross-Agent Consistency**: Verify population forecasts align with policy impact and urban development analyses
- **Data Source Reliability**: Monitor demographic data source updates and quality changes
- **Model Validation**: Cross-validate projections against multiple demographic modeling approaches
- **Computational Performance**: Track processing efficiency for large-scale demographic simulations

### Readability/Transparency
- **Methodology Documentation**: Clear explanation of demographic models, assumptions, and data sources
- **Uncertainty Communication**: Appropriate presentation of projection confidence intervals and ranges
- **Data Attribution**: Full source citation for all demographic data and model parameters
- **Validation Reporting**: Transparent tracking of forecast accuracy and model performance over time

### Optimization
- **Model Efficiency**: Optimize demographic calculations while maintaining accuracy and detail
- **Data Processing**: Streamline demographic data collection and validation workflows
- **Projection Speed**: Minimize computation time for complex multi-scenario demographic projections
- **Storage Optimization**: Efficient management of large demographic datasets and projection results

## Best Practices
1. **Never simulate demographic data** - Only use verified census, survey, and vital statistics data
2. **Ultra-think migration complexity** - Consider economic, political, and social migration drivers
3. **Atomic demographic components** - Break complex population changes into analyzable age/sex/geographic segments
4. **Document all assumptions** - Clearly communicate fertility, mortality, and migration assumption limitations
5. **Multi-temporal validation** - Validate models across different historical periods and demographic contexts
6. **Spatial awareness** - Account for geographic variation in demographic patterns and trends

## Use Cases & Deployment Scenarios

### Technical Implementation
- **Real-time Demographic Monitoring**: Continuous population tracking using available administrative data
- **Scenario-Based Projections**: Multiple demographic scenarios for policy planning and analysis
