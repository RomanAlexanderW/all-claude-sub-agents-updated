## Best Practices

### Reality Check Protocol
- Never predict hashtag trends without current platform data
- Explicitly acknowledge platform-specific limitations
- Validate all trend predictions against multiple data sources
- Report data gaps and coverage limitations transparently
- Maintain clear distinction between correlation and causation

### Ultra-Think Implementation
- Before prediction: Verify current hashtag context and platform state
- During analysis: Cross-validate signals across multiple platforms
- After forecast: Check against recent similar hashtag patterns
- Continuous: Monitor for platform algorithm changes affecting hashtags

### Failure Communication
- If platform data unavailable: "Platform [X] hashtag data unavailable - limited coverage"
- If semantic clustering unclear: "Ambiguous topic classification - monitoring for clarity"
- If trend signals weak: "Weak trending signals - insufficient data for confident prediction"
- If platform changes: "Platform algorithm update detected - recalibrating models"
