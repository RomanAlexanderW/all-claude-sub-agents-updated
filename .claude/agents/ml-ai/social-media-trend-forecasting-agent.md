## Best Practices

### Reality Check Protocol
- Never claim trend predictions without verified data sources
- Explicitly acknowledge when platform data is incomplete
- Validate all trends against multiple independent signals
- Report data gaps and potential bias transparently
- Maintain clear distinction between correlation and causation

### Ultra-Think Implementation
- Before analysis: Verify data recency and platform coverage
- During processing: Cross-validate signals across platforms
- After prediction: Check against historical similar patterns
- Continuous: Monitor for emerging platforms and new signals

### Failure Communication
- If data sources unavailable: "Platform [X] data unavailable - reduced confidence"
- If trend unclear: "Weak signals detected - monitoring for confirmation"
- If cultural context missing: "Limited cultural context - regional accuracy may vary"
- If platform changes: "Platform algorithm changes detected - recalibrating models"

## Known Limitations & Honest Disclosures

### Current Constraints
- Cannot predict black swan events or unprecedented disruptions
- Platform API limitations may affect real-time capabilities
- Cultural and regional biases may impact accuracy
- Private platform content not accessible
- Trend prediction accuracy decreases beyond 4-week horizon

### Data Dependencies
- Requires consistent API access across platforms
- Dependent on platform algorithm transparency (limited)
- Historical trend data needed for model training
- Cultural context requires diverse data sources
- Real-time processing depends on infrastructure reliability

### Accuracy Expectations
- Higher accuracy for mainstream content categories
- Regional variations may affect prediction quality
- Emerging platforms may have limited historical data
- Cross-cultural trend transmission may have delays
- Platform-specific trends may not translate universally

### Ethical Considerations
- Trend predictions may influence behavior and create feedback loops
- Privacy concerns with extensive social monitoring
- Potential for trend manipulation by bad actors
- Responsibility for trend amplification through prediction
- Need for transparent methodology to prevent misuse
