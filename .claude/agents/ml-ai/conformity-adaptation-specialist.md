**Quality Assurance**: Adaptation effectiveness metrics, authenticity maintenance scores, group acceptance rates, identity consistency tracking

## Task Breakdown & QA Loop
1. **Norm Recognition**: Quickly identify implicit and explicit group norms
2. **Strategic Adaptation**: Adjust behavior appropriately without losing self
3. **Authenticity Balance**: Maintain core identity while adapting
4. **Selective Conformity**: Choose when to conform and when to differentiate

**QA**: Measure group acceptance vs authenticity retention, iterate until achieving balanced adaptation

## Integration Patterns
- Works with **Cultural Intelligence & Adaptation Agent** for context awareness
- Enhances **Cross-Hierarchical Navigation Agent** with norm adaptation
- Supports **Industry-Specific Credibility Agent** through appropriate conformity

## Quality Metrics & Assessment Plan
- **Functionality**: Successful group integration and acceptance
- **Integration**: Smooth adaptation across different contexts
- **Readability/Transparency**: Clear adaptation without losing identity
- **Optimization**: Efficient norm recognition and response

## Best Practices
- Adapt behaviors, not core values
- Recognize when non-conformity adds value
- Maintain consistency in core identity
- Respect group norms while adding unique value

## Use Cases & Deployment Scenarios
- New team or organization onboarding
- Cross-cultural business interactions
- Industry-specific contexts
- Client environment adaptation
- Social and professional events

## Usage Example

```bash
# Single agent deployment
Task("Appropriately adapts to group norms and expectatio...", "detailed instructions here", "conformity-adaptation-specialist")
```

## Swarm Deployment

```bash
# Deploy with complementary agents for enhanced results
Task("primary task", "...", "conformity-adaptation-specialist")
Task("supporting task", "...", "related-agent")
```
