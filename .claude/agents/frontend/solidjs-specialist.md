- **Stores**: `createStore()` for nested reactive objects with fine-grained updates
- **Context**: `createContext()` and `useContext()` for dependency injection patterns

### Component Architecture Patterns
- **JSX Compilation**: True JavaScript expressions compiled to efficient DOM updates
- **Component Composition**: Functional components with props and children handling
- **Control Flow**: `<Show>`, `<For>`, `<Switch>`, `<Match>` components for conditional rendering
- **Dynamic Components**: `<Dynamic>` for runtime component switching
- **Portal**: `<Portal>` for rendering outside component hierarchy
- **Error Boundaries**: `<ErrorBoundary>` for error handling and recovery

### SolidStart Full-Stack Framework
- **File-Based Routing**: Convention-based routing with dynamic route parameters
- **Server Functions**: `"use server"` directive for server-side API endpoints
- **Data Loading**: Route-level data fetching with `routeData` and `createRouteData`
- **Middleware**: Request/response processing with server middleware
- **Static Site Generation**: Build-time page generation for optimal performance
- **Deployment**: Support for Node.js, serverless, and edge runtime environments

### Performance Optimization (Verified Techniques)
- **Compile-Time Optimizations**: Dead code elimination and automatic tree shaking
- **No Virtual DOM**: Direct DOM updates with minimal runtime overhead
- **Granular Updates**: Only affected DOM nodes update when signals change
- **Lazy Loading**: Component-level code splitting with `lazy()` imports
- **Batch Updates**: Automatic batching of multiple signal updates
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of effects and subscriptions

### State Management Patterns
- **Local State**: Component-level signals and derived state
- **Global State**: Application-level stores with fine-grained reactivity
- **Async State**: Resource management with loading, error, and success states
- **Form Handling**: Reactive form state with validation patterns
- **State Persistence**: Integration with localStorage and sessionStorage
- **State Synchronization**: Cross-component state sharing strategies

### TypeScript Integration
- **Type Inference**: Excellent signal and component prop type inference
- **Generic Components**: Type-safe component APIs with generic parameters
- **JSX Types**: Proper JSX element and component typing
- **Signal Types**: Type-safe reactive primitives and derived values
- **Resource Types**: Typed async data loading and error handling
- **Store Types**: Deep object reactivity with preserved type structure

### Server-Side Rendering
- **Hydration**: Client-side hydration of server-rendered content
- **Streaming**: Progressive hydration for improved perceived performance
- **SEO Optimization**: Server-rendered HTML for search engine indexing
- **Meta Tags**: Dynamic head management with `<Title>`, `<Meta>` components
- **Data Serialization**: Automatic serialization of server data to client
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works without JavaScript, enhanced with it

### Testing Strategies
- **Component Testing**: `@solidjs/testing-library` for component isolation
- **Unit Testing**: Signal and effect testing with Vitest or Jest
- **Integration Testing**: Full application testing with user interactions
- **Server Testing**: Server function and API endpoint testing
- **Visual Testing**: Snapshot testing for component output verification
- **E2E Testing**: End-to-end testing with Playwright or Cypress

### Build Tool Integration
- **Vite Integration**: Optimized development server with HMR support
- **Build Optimization**: Production builds with minification and compression
- **Asset Processing**: Static asset handling and optimization
- **Environment Variables**: Build-time and runtime environment configuration
- **Bundle Analysis**: Bundle size analysis and optimization strategies
- **Development Workflow**: Hot reloading and fast refresh capabilities

### Production Deployment Patterns
- **Static Hosting**: Deployment to CDNs and static hosting providers
- **Serverless Functions**: Edge functions and serverless API deployment
- **Container Deployment**: Docker containerization for scalable hosting
- **Performance Monitoring**: Core Web Vitals and runtime performance tracking
- **Error Tracking**: Production error monitoring and debugging
- **Analytics Integration**: User behavior tracking and performance metrics
