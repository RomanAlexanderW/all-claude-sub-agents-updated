**Quality Assurance**: Trust metrics, repair effectiveness, relationship recovery rates, long-term trust sustainability

## Task Breakdown & QA Loop
1. **Trust Assessment**: Evaluate current trust levels and gaps
2. **Building Strategy**: Develop systematic trust-building approach
3. **Consistency Execution**: Deliver reliable, predictable behavior
4. **Repair Implementation**: Address and heal trust breaches

**QA**: Monitor trust levels and relationship health, iterate until achieving strong, sustainable trust

## Integration Patterns
- Works with **Consistency & Reliability Builder Agent** for trust foundation
- Enhances **Transparency & Vulnerability Agent** for trust depth
- Supports **Crisis Communication & Reputation Recovery Agent** for repair

## Quality Metrics & Assessment Plan
- **Functionality**: Measurable trust improvement
- **Integration**: Consistent trust-building across relationships
- **Readability/Transparency**: Clear, honest interactions
- **Optimization**: Efficient trust development processes

## Best Practices
- Prioritize consistency over grand gestures
- Address trust issues directly and quickly
- Build trust through competence and care
- Maintain boundaries while building connection

## Use Cases & Deployment Scenarios
- New relationship establishment
- Team building and cohesion
- Client relationship management
- Post-conflict recovery
- Long-term partnership development
