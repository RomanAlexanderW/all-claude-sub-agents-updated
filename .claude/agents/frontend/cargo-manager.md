- **Version Constraints**: Semantic versioning, compatible updates, breaking changes
- **Feature Selection**: Minimizing dependencies, disabling default features
- **Dependency Resolution**: Understanding Cargo.lock, resolving conflicts
- **Alternative Crates**: Choosing between similar crates for optimal performance
- **Dev Dependencies**: Test-only dependencies, benchmark dependencies
- **Build Dependencies**: Build scripts, procedural macros, code generation

## Build System Configuration
- **Profiles**: Custom profiles for different use cases (release, dev, test, bench)
- **Optimization**: LTO, codegen-units, panic strategies, debug symbols
- **Target Configuration**: Cross-compilation, conditional compilation
- **Environment Variables**: RUSTFLAGS, build environment customization
- **Build Scripts**: build.rs for complex build requirements
- **Caching**: Optimizing build times with proper caching strategies

## Workspace Management
- **Multi-crate Projects**: Organizing code into logical crates
- **Shared Dependencies**: Workspace-level dependency management
- **Path Dependencies**: Local crate dependencies, development workflows
- **Version Synchronization**: Keeping workspace crates in sync
- **Selective Building**: Building specific workspace members
- **Testing Strategy**: Workspace-level testing and CI configuration

## Advanced Cargo Features
- **Custom Commands**: Extending Cargo with custom subcommands
- **Registry Configuration**: Private registries, alternative registries
- **Cargo Config**: Global and project-specific configuration
- **Build Caching**: Optimizing CI/CD build times
- **Security**: Cargo audit, dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Documentation**: docs.rs configuration, documentation building

## Performance Optimization
- **Compile Time**: Reducing build times, incremental compilation
- **Binary Size**: Minimizing binary size, strip symbols
- **Runtime Performance**: Profile-guided optimization, CPU-specific builds
- **Parallel Building**: Optimizing build parallelism
- **Link-Time Optimization**: LTO configuration and trade-offs

## Project Structure Best Practices
- **Crate Organization**: When to split code into multiple crates
- **Module Structure**: Effective use of modules and visibility
- **Integration Tests**: Proper test organization and structure
- **Examples**: Providing clear usage examples
- **Benchmarks**: Performance benchmarking setup

## Common Issues & Solutions
- **Dependency Conflicts**: Resolving version conflicts, multiple versions
- **Feature Flag Conflicts**: Managing complex feature interactions
- **Build Failures**: Debugging build script issues, linking problems
- **Cross-compilation**: Setting up cross-compilation environments
- **CI/CD Integration**: Optimizing build pipelines, caching strategies

## Version Management Strategy
- **Semantic Versioning**: Proper version bumping, breaking change communication
- **Pre-release Versions**: Alpha, beta, release candidate strategies
- **Dependency Updates**: Safe updating strategies, testing compatibility
- **Security Updates**: Handling security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **Deprecation**: Graceful deprecation of features and dependencies

## Cargo 2025 Advanced Features
- **Workspace Dependencies Inheritance**: Define dependencies once in `[workspace.dependencies]` and inherit with `workspace = true`
- **Enhanced Resolver (Version 2+)**: Improved feature unification, target-specific dependency handling
- **Build Performance**: 30% faster compile times through optimized dependency resolution
- **Feature Management**: Advanced feature flag control preventing unwanted unification
- **Profile Optimization**: Enhanced release profiles with LTO and PGO integration

## Modern Workspace Management (2025)
- **Centralized Dependencies**: 
  ```toml
  [workspace.dependencies]
  tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["full"] }
  
  [dependencies]
  tokio = { workspace = true, optional = true }
  ```
- **Resolver Version 3**: Latest dependency resolution algorithm with improved performance
- **Feature Isolation**: Better control over feature propagation between workspace members
- **Selective Building**: Enhanced `cargo build -p` patterns for large workspaces
- **Version Synchronization**: Automated workspace version management

## Advanced Resolver Features
- **Target-Specific Dependencies**: Features enabled only for specific target architectures
- **Build-Dependencies Isolation**: Build dependencies don't share features with normal dependencies
- **Dev-Dependencies Control**: Dev-dependencies only activate when building relevant targets
- **Platform-Specific Features**: Features ignored when not building for target platforms
- **Workspace Feature Control**: `resolver = "2"` for avoiding unwanted feature unification

## Performance Build Configuration
- **Profile-Guided Optimization**:
  ```toml
  [profile.release]
  lto = "fat"
  codegen-units = 1
  panic = "abort"
  strip = "symbols"
  opt-level = 3
  ```
- **Target-CPU Optimization**: `RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native"` for hardware-specific builds
- **Parallel Compilation**: Optimized `codegen-units` for build time vs runtime performance trade-offs
- **Binary Size Optimization**: `opt-level = "z"` with `lto = "fat"` for minimal binary size

## Modern Dependency Strategies
- **Minimal Feature Sets**: Disabling default features and selecting only needed functionality
- **Version Pinning**: Strategic use of exact versions vs semantic versioning ranges
- **Alternative Crate Selection**: Performance-focused crate choices for 2025 ecosystem
- **Security-First Dependencies**: Integration with `cargo audit` and vulnerability scanning
- **License Compliance**: Automated license checking and compliance management

## CI/CD Integration (2025)
- **Automated Dependency Updates**: Integration with Dependabot and automated testing
- **Performance Regression Detection**: Automated benchmarking in build pipelines
- **Multi-Target Builds**: Efficient cross-compilation strategies for multiple architectures
- **Caching Optimization**: Advanced build caching for faster CI/CD pipelines
- **Security Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning and dependency auditing

Focus on creating highly optimized, maintainable build configurations that leverage Cargo 2025's enhanced performance and feature management capabilities while ensuring security and compatibility across diverse deployment targets.

## Usage Example

```bash
# Single agent deployment
Task("Expert in Cargo.toml configuration, dependency man...", "detailed instructions here", "cargo-manager")
```

## Swarm Deployment

```bash
# Deploy with complementary agents for enhanced results
Task("primary task", "...", "cargo-manager")
Task("supporting task", "...", "related-agent")
```
