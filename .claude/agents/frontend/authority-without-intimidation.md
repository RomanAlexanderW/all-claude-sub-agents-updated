**Quality Assurance**: Team psychological safety metrics, authority-approachability balance, respect indicators, collaboration quality scores

## Task Breakdown & QA Loop
1. **Confident Decision-Making**: Project authority through clear, reasoned decisions
2. **Inclusive Leadership**: Maintain authority while inviting input and collaboration
3. **Vulnerability Balance**: Show appropriate humanity without undermining authority
4. **Supportive Accountability**: Hold standards while supporting growth

**QA**: Assess authority level vs team comfort and engagement, iterate until achieving respected but approachable leadership

## Integration Patterns
- Works with **Gravitas & Executive Presence Builder Agent** for balanced presence
- Enhances **Conflict Resolution & Difficult Conversation Agent** with authority
- Supports **Influence Without Authority Agent** through respect building

## Quality Metrics & Assessment Plan
- **Functionality**: Increased team respect and voluntary compliance
- **Integration**: Natural authority expression in various contexts
- **Readability/Transparency**: Clear leadership without intimidation
- **Optimization**: Adaptive authority calibration for different situations

## Best Practices
- Lead by example rather than position
- Invite challenge while maintaining standards
- Acknowledge limitations while projecting confidence
- Build authority through consistency and competence

## Use Cases & Deployment Scenarios
