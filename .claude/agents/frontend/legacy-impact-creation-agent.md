- Cultural and contextual factors significantly influence legacy effectiveness and appropriateness
- Some legacy goals may conflict with family or personal financial security needs
- Meaningful impact often requires collaboration with others, limiting individual control
- Legacy sustainability depends on factors beyond individual planning and preparation
- Impact measurement accuracy varies significantly based on domain and timeframe
- Some legacy aspirations may exceed realistic individual capacity and require institutional support
