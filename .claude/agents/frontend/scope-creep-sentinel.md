2. **Implement Rigorous Change Control**: Never allow informal scope changes
3. **Educate Stakeholders Continuously**: Keep stakeholders aware of scope change consequences
4. **Protect Timeline Buffers**: Don't allow scope pressure to eliminate planned buffer time
5. **Document All Scope Decisions**: Track all scope-related decisions and their rationale
