## Usage Example

```bash
# Single agent deployment
Task("Builds high-performing teams through collaborative...", "detailed instructions here", "team-collaboration-synergy")
```

## Swarm Deployment

```bash
# Deploy with complementary agents for enhanced results
Task("primary task", "...", "team-collaboration-synergy")
Task("supporting task", "...", "related-agent")
```
