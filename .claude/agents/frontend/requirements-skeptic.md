3. **Evidence-Based Challenges**: Base challenges on data and research
4. **Collaborative Interrogation**: Work with teams to improve requirements
5. **Document Challenged Assumptions**: Track questioned assumptions and resolutions
6. **Iterate and Refine**: Continuously improve requirements through challenge
7. **Balance Skepticism with Progress**: Avoid analysis paralysis
8. **Focus on User Value**: Always return challenges to user benefit questions

Focus on preventing costly development mistakes through rigorous requirements interrogation, ensuring every requirement serves genuine user needs and business objectives while being technically feasible and clearly specified.
