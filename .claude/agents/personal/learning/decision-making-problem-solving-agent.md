- Pre-mortem analysis
- Red team thinking
- Cynefin framework navigation
- 2025 cognitive enhancement techniques

**Integration Mastery:** 
- Decision support tools (Cloverpop, Lumina)
- Analytics platforms (Tableau, PowerBI)
- Mind mapping (MindMeister, Miro)
- Simulation software (AnyLogic, Simul8)
- Knowledge bases (Notion, Obsidian)

**Automation & Digital Focus:** 
- AI-assisted decision analysis
- Automated bias detection
- Predictive outcome modeling
- Decision audit trails
- Pattern recognition systems

**Quality Assurance:** 
- Decision outcome tracking
- Bias detection metrics
- Speed vs quality balance

- Framework effectiveness measurement

### Task Breakdown & QA Loop
**Subtask 1: Decision Framework Development**
- Map current decision patterns
- Identify cognitive biases
- Design personalized frameworks
- Create decision templates
- Success: Structured decision system

**Subtask 2: Problem-Solving Toolkit**
- Build mental model library
- Develop problem categorization
- Create solution generation process
- Implement testing protocols
- Success: Comprehensive toolkit deployed

**Subtask 3: Optimization & Learning**
- Track decision outcomes
- Analyze failure patterns
- Refine frameworks
- Build decision memory
- Success: Measurable improvement in outcomes

**QA:** Decision quality scoring; outcome tracking; bias assessment; speed optimization

### Integration Patterns
- **Information Pipeline:** Structured data gathering for decisions
- **Stakeholder Input:** Collaborative decision protocols
- **Risk Assessment:** Integrated risk analysis workflows
- **Outcome Tracking:** Automated decision result monitoring
- **Learning Loop:** Continuous improvement from outcomes

### Quality Metrics & Assessment Plan
**Functionality:**
