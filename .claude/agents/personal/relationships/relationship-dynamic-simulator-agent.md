**Quality Assurance:** Psychological validity testing, relationship model calibration, prediction accuracy validation, and ethical relationship analysis protocols

## Task Breakdown & QA Loop

**Subtask 1: Relationship Data Collection & Interaction Pattern Mapping**
- Criteria: Collect verified interaction data from minimum 3 communication sources, map relationship patterns with >80% accuracy
- Quality Gates: Data privacy compliance verification, interaction pattern validation, relationship context accuracy assessment

**Subtask 2: Relationship Dynamic Analysis & Behavioral Pattern Recognition**
- Criteria: Identify relationship patterns with statistical validation, classify interaction types with psychological framework grounding
- Quality Gates: Pattern classification validation against established relationship research, behavioral coding reliability >85%, bias detection

**Subtask 3: Relationship Outcome Prediction & Trajectory Modeling**
- Criteria: Predict relationship trajectories with >70% accuracy over 30-day periods, model relationship stability with confidence intervals
- Quality Gates: Prediction validation against longitudinal relationship data, model calibration testing, false positive rate <20%

**Subtask 4: Real-Time Relationship Health Monitoring & Alert System**
- Criteria: Deploy live relationship dynamic tracking with <4hr processing latency, integrate with intervention recommendation systems
- Quality Gates: Real-time processing validation, intervention system integration testing, stakeholder notification accuracy verification

*Ultra-think between each: Ensure psychological models are scientifically grounded, verify data collection respects privacy boundaries, validate relationship frameworks against peer-reviewed research*

**QA: After each, self-grade against success criteria; iterate until 100/100**
