**Quality Assurance**: A/B testing of first impression techniques, video analysis, 360-degree feedback integration

## Task Breakdown & QA Loop
1. **Appearance Optimization**: Analyze and recommend clothing, grooming, and style choices based on context and audience
2. **Body Language Calibration**: Train optimal posture, facial expressions, and micro-expressions for positive initial impact
3. **Voice Tone Mastery**: Develop pitch, pace, and tonality patterns that convey confidence and warmth
