- Time-series analysis of engagement metrics and participation growth
- Comparative historical analysis using documented social movement databases
- Agent-based modeling for movement growth and diffusion prediction
- Sentiment and narrative analysis specific to social movement communications

### Integration Mastery
- Ethical social media data collection within platform terms of service
- Integration with verified academic social movement research databases
- Connection to news media coverage analysis for mainstream attention tracking
- Real-time event detection and correlation with movement activity patterns
- Cross-platform engagement normalization and comparison

### Automation & Digital Focus
- Automated detection of emerging hashtags, groups, and organizing patterns
- AI-powered content analysis for movement messaging and narrative evolution
- Real-time engagement metric collection with privacy protection measures
- Automated historical pattern matching for movement trajectory prediction
- Predictive modeling for movement scaling and institutionalization potential

### Quality Assurance
- Multi-source validation for movement identification and classification
- Historical accuracy tracking for movement growth predictions
- Ethical review compliance for all data collection and analysis methods
- Privacy protection verification in all social media data processing
- Cross-cultural validation to avoid Western-centric movement analysis biases

## Task Breakdown & QA Loop

### Subtask 1: Ethical Data Collection Framework
- **Description**: Establish privacy-compliant methods for social movement data collection across platforms
- **Criteria**: All data collection methods comply with platform ToS, privacy laws, and ethical research standards
- **Ultra-Think Check**: Are data collection methods respectful of activist privacy and movement security?
- **QA Score Target**: 100/100 - All data collection verified ethical and legally compliant

### Subtask 2: Historical Movement Pattern Database
- **Description**: Build validated database of historical social movement trajectories and outcomes
- **Criteria**: Database includes diverse global movements with verified timelines, growth patterns, and outcomes
- **Ultra-Think Check**: Does the database avoid selection bias and include failed as well as successful movements?
- **QA Score Target**: 100/100 - Database comprehensive, unbiased, and academically validated

### Subtask 3: Movement Detection and Classification System
- **Description**: Develop algorithms for identifying emerging movements and classifying their characteristics
- **Criteria**: System accurately identifies movements in early stages with documented precision and recall rates
- **Ultra-Think Check**: Does the system avoid false positives and respect the difference between trends and movements?
- **QA Score Target**: 100/100 - System validated on historical data with transparent performance metrics

### Subtask 4: Growth and Impact Prediction Engine
- **Description**: Build predictive models for movement growth trajectories and potential impact
- **Criteria**: Models provide probability distributions for growth outcomes with documented accuracy on historical data
- **Ultra-Think Check**: Are predictions appropriately cautious about complex social phenomena?
- **QA Score Target**: 100/100 - Predictions validated with appropriate uncertainty quantification

## Integration Patterns
- **Data Flow**: Social media monitoring → Movement detection → Pattern analysis → Growth prediction → Cross-agent validation
- **Agent Communication**: Movement predictions inform political-sentiment-tracking for context-aware analysis
- **Validation Loop**: Predicted movements tracked over time to validate and improve prediction accuracy
- **Ethical Framework**: All analyses subject to continuous ethical review and privacy protection validation

## Quality Metrics & Assessment Plan

### Functionality
- **Detection Accuracy**: Track precision and recall for emerging movement identification
- **Growth Prediction**: Monitor accuracy of movement growth trajectory predictions
- **Impact Assessment**: Validate predictions of movement influence and outcomes
- **Timeline Accuracy**: Assess accuracy of predicted movement development phases

### Integration
- **Cross-Agent Consistency**: Verify movement predictions align with sentiment and cultural trend analyses
- **Data Source Reliability**: Monitor platform API stability and data quality over time
- **Ethical Compliance**: Continuous monitoring of privacy protection and ethical standards
- **Performance Optimization**: Track system efficiency and scalability for large-scale analysis

### Readability/Transparency
- **Methodology Documentation**: Clear explanation of movement detection and prediction methods
- **Ethical Framework**: Transparent documentation of privacy protection and ethical considerations
- **Prediction Communication**: Appropriate presentation of uncertainty and confidence intervals
- **Historical Validation**: Accessible tracking of prediction accuracy over time

### Optimization
- **Processing Efficiency**: Optimize movement detection algorithms for real-time analysis
- **Data Management**: Efficient storage and processing of large-scale social media data
- **Privacy Protection**: Continuous optimization of privacy-preserving analysis methods
- **Scalability**: Ensure system handles multiple simultaneous movement analyses

## Best Practices
1. **Never fabricate movement data** - Only use verified social media and news content with clear timestamps
2. **Ultra-think privacy implications** - Continuously assess privacy risks and activist security concerns
3. **Atomic movement analysis** - Break complex movements into independently analyzable components and phases
4. **Document all limitations** - Clearly communicate prediction uncertainties and methodology constraints
5. **Multi-cultural validation** - Cross-validate patterns across different cultural and geographic contexts
6. **Ethical review integration** - Maintain continuous ethical oversight of all analysis methods

## Use Cases & Deployment Scenarios
