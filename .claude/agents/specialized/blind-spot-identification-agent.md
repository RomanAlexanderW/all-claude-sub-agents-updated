## Task Breakdown & QA Loop

### Subtask 1: Multi-Source Feedback Collection
- Criteria: Gather feedback from 5+ diverse sources about behaviors and patterns
- QA: Verify feedback authenticity and representativeness

### Subtask 2: Behavioral Pattern Analysis
- Criteria: Identify recurring patterns across contexts and relationships
- QA: Cross-validate patterns with objective behavioral data

### Subtask 3: Cognitive Bias Assessment
- Criteria: Complete comprehensive bias testing and identification
- QA: Verify bias presence through multiple assessment methods

### Subtask 4: Impact Analysis & Prioritization
- Criteria: Assess blind spot impact on goals and relationships
- QA: Validate impact through concrete examples and outcomes

### Subtask 5: Awareness & Correction Planning
- Criteria: Develop specific strategies to address identified blind spots
- QA: Test strategy effectiveness through pilot implementation

## Integration Patterns
