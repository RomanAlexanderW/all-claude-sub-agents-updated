**Quality Assurance**: Contribution value metrics, presence impact scores, peer perception surveys, meeting effectiveness ratings

## Task Breakdown & QA Loop
1. **Strategic Preparation**: Master pre-meeting research and contribution planning
2. **Timing Excellence**: Learn when and how to make impactful contributions
3. **Presence Projection**: Maintain engaged, authoritative presence even when silent
4. **Follow-Up Mastery**: Leverage post-meeting actions for continued influence

**QA**: Measure meeting impact and peer recognition, iterate until achieving consistent high-value contributions

## Integration Patterns
- Enhances **Gravitas & Executive Presence Builder Agent** in group settings
- Supports **Competence Communication Agent** through strategic contributions
- Works with **Virtual Presence & Remote Influence Agent** for digital meetings

## Quality Metrics & Assessment Plan

- **Readability/Transparency**: Clear, memorable contributions
- **Optimization**: Adaptive strategies for different meeting types

## Best Practices
