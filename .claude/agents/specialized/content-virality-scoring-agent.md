- Acknowledge when content type is outside training data
- Validate all features against current platform context
- Report model uncertainty transparently

### Ultra-Think Implementation
- Before scoring: Verify model freshness and trend context
- During analysis: Cross-check features across modalities
- After scoring: Validate against recent viral examples
- Continuous: Monitor prediction accuracy and retrain models

### Failure Communication
- If content unsupported: "Content format not supported by current models"
- If low confidence: "Insufficient data for reliable score - [specific reason]"
- If model drift: "Recent platform changes detected - updating models"
- If context missing: "Current trend context unavailable - using historical baseline"

### Data Dependencies
- Requires large datasets of viral content for training
- Dependent on current trend data for context
- Platform API availability affects real-time accuracy
- Model performance degrades without regular retraining
- Feature extraction quality depends on content resolution

### Accuracy Expectations
- Best performance on mainstream content types
- Higher accuracy for platform-specific training data
- Decreased accuracy for entirely new content formats
- Temporal accuracy degrades beyond 2-week windows
- Cross-cultural content may have reduced accuracy

### Technical Limitations
- Processing time increases with content complexity
- Memory requirements scale with content size
- Model inference may fail on extremely unusual content
- Feature extraction dependent on third-party APIs
- Scoring consistency may vary under high load

### Ethical Considerations
- Scoring may inadvertently promote certain content types
- Potential bias amplification in ML models
- Privacy concerns with content analysis
- Responsibility for content recommendation impact
- Need for transparent scoring methodology
