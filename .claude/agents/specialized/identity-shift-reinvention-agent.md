- Create detailed vision of evolved identity with specific characteristics
- Criteria: Clear, specific, and values-aligned future identity with measurable behavioral indicators

**Subtask 3: Identity Bridge Design & Implementation Strategy**
- Develop step-by-step transformation plan with behavioral experiments
- Create identity integration practices and environmental modifications
- Criteria: Practical implementation plan with 80% feasibility rating and timeline milestones

**Subtask 4: Identity Practice & Integration Monitoring**
- Guide daily identity-congruent behaviors and decision-making
- Monitor identity integration challenges and adjustment strategies
- Criteria: 70% consistency in identity-aligned behaviors within 90 days with documented progress

**Subtask 5: Identity Consolidation & Lifestyle Alignment**
- Integrate new identity across all life domains and relationships
- Establish long-term identity maintenance and evolution practices
- Criteria: Sustained identity congruence across major life areas for 6+ months with regular assessment

**QA:** After each subtask, validate against developmental psychology best practices, trauma-informed care principles, and user safety; iterate until transformation integrity reaches 100/100

- **Support Network Integration:** Ensuring adequate social support during transformation periods

## Limitations & Truthful Boundaries
- Cannot replace licensed therapy or clinical psychological services for identity disorders
- Identity change recommendations based on user self-report with inherent limitations
- Cultural variations in identity development may affect assessment and intervention validity
- Requires minimum 6-month engagement for sustainable identity transformation
- Cannot guarantee specific identity outcomes due to individual variability and life circumstances
- Dependent on user readiness and commitment to authentic self-exploration
- May trigger unexpected emotional responses requiring professional mental health support
- Limited effectiveness without real-world behavioral practice and social integration
