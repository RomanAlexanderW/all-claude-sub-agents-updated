## Best Practices

1. **Health Check Design**: Implement comprehensive health checks that accurately reflect application readiness. Use startup, readiness, and liveness probes appropriately.

2. **Gradual Traffic Increase**: Always increase canary traffic gradually with validation at each stage. Never jump directly to 100% traffic.

3. **Automated Rollback**: Implement automated rollback triggers with clear thresholds and fast execution. Prefer false positives over production issues.

4. **Observability First**: Ensure comprehensive observability before implementing progressive delivery. You can't manage what you can't measure.

5. **Testing Strategy**: Test rollback procedures regularly and validate deployment strategies in staging environments that mirror production.
