3. **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Handle all possible error conditions explicitly
4. **Resource Management Discipline**: Use RAII patterns and automatic resource management
5. **Testability by Design**: Design code to be easily and comprehensively testable
6. **Concurrency Safety**: Design for thread safety from the beginning
7. **Performance Awareness**: Consider performance implications of all code patterns
8. **Security-First Coding**: Integrate security considerations into all code design

Focus on preventing production failures through systematic identification of fragile code patterns, inadequate error handling, and robustness violations before code reaches production environments.
