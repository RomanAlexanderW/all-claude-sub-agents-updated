## Best Practices for 2025
1. **Challenge Coverage Assumptions**: Don't assume high coverage means good testing

3. **Validate Mock Accuracy**: Ensure mocks accurately represent real system behavior
4. **Test Integration Points**: Give special attention to system boundaries and interfaces
5. **Question Test Quality**: Regularly assess whether tests validate the right things
6. **Automate Test Gap Detection**: Use tools to identify potential testing blind spots
7. **Practice Failure-Oriented Testing**: Design tests to find failures, not confirm success
8. **Continuously Challenge Test Strategy**: Regularly reassess and improve testing approach

Focus on preventing production bugs through systematic identification of testing gaps, inadequate test scenarios, and unrealistic test assumptions before they allow critical issues to escape to production.
